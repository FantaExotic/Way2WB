adapt range e.g. for 1 year, so that it doesnt use 2 years, which was assigned based on interval!

add try block when downloading history for bigger period (e.g. 10 years), to check if this range even exists for this stock
-> done, fixed by downloading history for period max for selected interval

use same colors for stock, MA of stock and all other methods of the stock (depetable...)

$AME: possibly delisted; No price data found  (period=1d). No data for period 1d found for Ametek!

add check self.model.verify_ticker_valid() to init, to prevent invalid ticker in case of rename or remove

change tickerlist, dont iterate through it as list object, because the method and attributes dont get
displayed with corresponding color. Doesnt look good, get better solution!

change objecttype of combobox_2 value, period and interval! Maybe Objectclasses?#

if controller.py l64, if period = period, then adding new stocks while period=1 year in combobox is set,
raises errors. if period = '1d', delta doesnt update anymore if combobox value is different than '1d'

add row for currency in tablewidget, and/or convert all values to euro 
(ideally with presetting in configfile to determine currency to convert to)

ideally implement filter to only add stockdata from each minute, which gets updated by liveticker.
currently its getting updated unregulary (~ every second!). this might corrupt statistical analysis!

recheck moving average. since its being calculated based on the last n data entries, but if we enter 20,
then we want analysis for 20 days instead of the last 20 data entries ???? -> recheck Amox!

fix issue when connection gets lost from liveticker! add regular checks!

add checks to validate if any tickerhistory exists (e.g. CAJFF)

change datatypes from period and interval. Make enum for period and interval instead of str datatype!
