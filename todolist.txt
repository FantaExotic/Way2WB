adapt range e.g. for 1 year, so that it doesnt use 2 years, which was assigned based on interval!

add try block when downloading history for bigger period (e.g. 10 years), to check if this range even exists for this stock
-> done, fixed by downloading history for period max for selected interval

use same colors for stock, MA of stock and all other methods of the stock (depetable...)

$AME: possibly delisted; No price data found  (period=1d). No data for period 1d found for Ametek!

add check self.model.verify_ticker_valid() to init, to prevent invalid ticker in case of rename or remove

change tickerlist, dont iterate through it as list object, because the method and attributes dont get
displayed with corresponding color. Doesnt look good, get better solution!

change objecttype of combobox_2 value, period and interval! Maybe Objectclasses?#

if controller.py l64, if period = period, then adding new stocks while period=1 year in combobox is set,
raises errors. if period = '1d', delta doesnt update anymore if combobox value is different than '1d'
