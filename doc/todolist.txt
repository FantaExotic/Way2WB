adapt range e.g. for 1 year, so that it doesnt use 2 years, which was assigned based on interval!

add try block when downloading history for bigger period (e.g. 10 years), to check if this range even exists for this stock
-> done, fixed by downloading history for period max for selected interval

use same colors for stock, MA of stock and all other methods of the stock (depetable...)

$AME: possibly delisted; No price data found  (period=1d). No data for period 1d found for Ametek!

add check self.model.verify_ticker_valid() to init, to prevent invalid ticker in case of rename or remove

change tickerlist, dont iterate through it as list object, because the method and attributes dont get
displayed with corresponding color. Doesnt look good, get better solution!

change objecttype of combobox_2 value, period and interval! Maybe Objectclasses?#

if controller.py l64, if period = period, then adding new stocks while period=1 year in combobox is set,
raises errors. if period = '1d', delta doesnt update anymore if combobox value is different than '1d'

add row for currency in tablewidget, and/or convert all values to euro 
(ideally with presetting in configfile to determine currency to convert to)

ideally implement filter to only add stockdata from each minute, which gets updated by liveticker.
currently its getting updated unregulary (~ every second!). this might corrupt statistical analysis!

recheck moving average. since its being calculated based on the last n data entries, but if we enter 20,
then we want analysis for 20 days instead of the last 20 data entries ???? -> recheck Amox!

fix issue when connection gets lost from liveticker! add regular checks!

add checks to validate if any tickerhistory exists (e.g. CAJFF)

change datatypes from period and interval. Make enum for period and interval instead of str datatype!

potential bug: when doing cuurency conversion, volumes also get conversion.
this needs to be adapted, since volume isnt represented as number with currency

new tasks - old ones seem to be solved

make sure timestamps with timezone (e.g. 15.10.23 16:41 - 4:00) gets converted to 15.10.23 22:41 (CEST +2) for all dataframes in tickerhistory

increment current timestamp in liveticker to prevent duplicate data for same timestamp!

recheck ametek before 2pm, i get error when accessing data for today because its empty before 2pm

bug when period=1d is selected, then liveticker will only update in self.tickerwrapper.tickerhistory["1m"],
but not in self.tickerwrapper.tickerhistory["current"]. fix this!
other periods dont have to be considered, since lvieticker only gets appended to self.tickerwrapper.tickerhistory["1m"]
consequence: latest liveticker data will not be printed when pressing genGraph!

create individual case for period="1d". dont create it based on period="5d".
adapt handling in historymanager and set default period="1d".
reason: prevent case where no data for this day is present

TODO: case where e.g. period="2y" results in period="max" because only period=1y exists,
check if generation of period=1y or period=2y works correct in self.current_tickerhistory
see in: self.tickerwrapper.update_current_tickerhistory()


New TODOS (need to recheck old ones!):

cleanup git ignore to remove all *.pyc files in pycache folder

feature executable:
    - create startup view to select watchlist
    - add button and label:
        button: on click loads file explorer to select watchlistfile
        label: shows the loaded watchlistfile
        
    - optional: create init/config file to store and load latest watchlist file
    -

Racecondition issue due to liveticker running in different thread:
this happens when ticker gets removed from watchlist (via gui). then it can happen that it wasnt unsubscribed yet.
then eventHandler_liveticker_update wants to update new value in pandas dataframe from tickerwrapper, but there the tickerwrapper has already been removed
See below error:

Error in message handler: 'NVDA'
Traceback (most recent call last):

- make a cyclic task, which adds the price received from liveticker to each tickerhistory for interval = 1 min.
  currently its always being written when new value is received, but then the tickerhistory for all periods which have interval = 1min are not consistent anymore.
